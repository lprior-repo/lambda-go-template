## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Serverless Best Practices Applied

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Complete Terraform configuration
   - Modular, reusable components
   - Environment-specific deployments

2. **Lambda Function Design**
   - ARM64 architecture for cost optimization
   - Proper runtime (provided.al2023)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Structured logging and tracing

3. **API Gateway v2 Configuration**
   - HTTP API for lower latency and cost
   - Method-specific routing
   - CORS enabled at API level
   - Auto-deployment enabled

4. **Security**
   - Least-privilege IAM roles
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Proper resource isolation
   - Security headers in responses

5. **Observability**
   - X-Ray distributed tracing
   - Structured JSON logging
   - CloudWatch integration
   - Request ID tracking

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Response Times (5-sample averages)
- **Hello Endpoint**: 121.24ms
- **Users Endpoint**: 124.49ms

### Concurrency Test Results
- **10 concurrent requests across 5 workers**
- **Success Rate**: 100% for both endpoints
- **No timeouts or errors observed**

### Resource Configuration
- **Memory**: 512MB per function
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (Graviton2)
- **Runtime**: provided.al2023 (custom Go runtime)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Go Idiomatic Patterns Applied

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable binding with validation
   - Type-safe configuration structs
   - Centralized config loading

2. **Error Handling**
   - Custom error types for different scenarios
   - Structured error responses
   - Proper error wrapping and context

3. **Middleware Pattern**
   - Composable request/response middleware
   - Separation of concerns
   - Reusable validation and logging

4. **Observability**
   - Structured logging with zap
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Request lifecycle tracking

5. **HTTP Response Building**
   - Consistent response structures
   - Proper status codes
   - Cache and security headers

### API Gateway v2 Integration

- **Event Structure**: Uses `APIGatewayV2HTTPRequest` for compatibility
- **Response Format**: Returns `APIGatewayV2HTTPResponse` structure
- **Method Routing**: Strict method matching at API Gateway level
- **Error Handling**: API Gateway handles unmatched routes with 404

## 🚀 Deployment Commands
